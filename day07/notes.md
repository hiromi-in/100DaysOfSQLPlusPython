### Day7: Find all orders of category “Electronics.”  

Today's target also was filters.
SQL: Used where clause.
Python: Simple filter. (df\[df\[column\_name]==value])
Comment: It is very handy to have AI's support. I didn't need any help with showing all orders with a filter but creating a chart part needed it. I could do it without AI but it should have taken so much longer.
