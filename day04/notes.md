### Day3: Count number of customers.

Today's target was aggregation with some filters.
SQL: Used count and distinct function.
Python: len() and nunique() function to see the number of rows. 
Comment: len()function is quite handy but when we have more than a filter, we cannot use it. When we use group by statement in sql, we need to be careful with what we want to filter.
