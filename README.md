# 100 Days of Data Engineering & Analytics Challenge

Welcome to my **100-day challenge**, where I build one data engineering or analytics project every day using **Python, SQL, and real-world style datasets**.  
This repository is my learning log, project archive, and public accountability tracker.

---

## 🚀 Goals of This Challenge
- Build **100 portfolio-ready mini-projects**
- Improve in **SQL, Python, ETL, data modeling, analysis, and pipeline design**
- Learn consistently through small, daily wins
- Share progress publicly to stay accountable
- Build a habit of creating instead of consuming
