### Day3: Count number of orders.  

Today's target was aggregation.
  
SQL: Used count function. I counted the orders by some items. 
Python: describe() function to see the number of rows. I also counted the number of orders in each quartile.

Comment: It seems like randomizing worked as the distribution of data is not equal by each quartile in price and quantity category.
